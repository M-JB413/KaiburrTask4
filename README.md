# Kaiburr Task 4
## CI-CD pipeline for the application built in Task 1

### About the task 
The entire source code of the application is pushed to the repository and the CI/CD workflow is automated. The tool used to automate the workflow is using GitHub Actions. Since GitHub is used as a repository to store code, it can directly be used as a CI/CD tool. This way it makes integration easier. Whenever there is a push or pull request action to the repository, the corresponding action takes place. Hence an `action` for an `event`. 

&emsp;Task 1: Build the Spring Boot project using Maven.  
&emsp;Task 2: Dockerize the resulting package or JAR using docker.  
&emsp;Task 3: Push the docker image to the `docker hub repository`.
